I currently work as a full-stack C\# .NET developer for Waystar, 
a health care solutions company that automates connecting patient and insurance provider information for hospitals. 
Besides developing web features with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap, and JavaScript and jQuery, 
my job regularly requires me to model different business domains 
via both SQL database tables and C\# classes mapped to these via the Entity Framework ORM. 
This has allowed me to build projects with concrete value on the theoretical foundation that my background in philosophy and semantics provides me with, 
and has expanded that foundation to include experience normalizing databases and writing queries, joins and CRUD operations, 
both in SQL and in C\# with LINQ.
