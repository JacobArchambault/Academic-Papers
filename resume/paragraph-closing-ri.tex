A copy of my resume with my contact information is prepended to this letter. I grew up in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, not far from \city{}, and most of my family still lives in the surrounding area. I have been looking to return there, and would be happy if the \position{} opening brought me to do so. I look forward to hearing from you.
