Prior to my current position, I taught metaphysics and Latin at Highlands Latin School, an advanced classical high school in Louisville, Kentucky. My metaphysics teaching focused on the full reconstruction of multi-part textual arguments given only in enthymematic form, and on categories and other divisions of being in Aristotle's \emph{Metaphysics}. The first provides a basis for representing inferences found in natural languages, while the latter provides a philosophical basis for work in computational ontology. Teaching Latin grammar has provided an additional resource, that of a more regimented natural language, to draw on in representing relations between entity types.
