I received a PhD in philosophy 
in August 2017 
from Fordham University. 
Since 2014 I have published 
numerous journal articles, book contributions, and an edited volume 
in fields including 
ontology, 
the philosophy of logic, 
and the history of science, 
and presented papers at institutions across three continents.
My dissertation traced the earliest development of the concept of formal consequence, 
central to logic today, 
in late medieval logic, 
which demanded 
broad knowledge 
of the history of philosophy, 
of medieval Latin, 
and of semantics for classical and non-classical logics, 
as well as  
facility with translating between natural and formal languages.
