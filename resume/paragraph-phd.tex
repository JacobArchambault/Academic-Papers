Prior to my current position, I received a PhD in philosophy, specializing in logic, and a doctoral certificate in medieval philosophy
from Fordham University. 
Since 2014 I have published 
numerous journal articles, book contributions, and an edited volume 
in 
ontology, 
the philosophy of logic, 
and the history of science, 
and presented papers introducing new results in logic, semantics, and medieval philosophy across three continents.
My dissertation, which traced the earliest development of the concept of formal consequence
in late medieval logic, demanded 
broad knowledge 
%of the history of philosophy, 
%of medieval Latin, 
%and 
of semantics for classical and non-classical logics 
as well as  
expertise with translating between natural and formal languages.  
This background has allowed me to build projects with concrete value on a strong theoretical foundation, 
which I've since expanded to include experience normalizing databases and writing advanced SQL queries and CRUD operations.
