\section{Buridan's definition of consequence and Pseudo-Scotus' paradox}
In his \textit{Treatise on Consequences}, the medieval logician John Buridan defines consequence as follows:
\begin{quote}
A consequence is a hypothetical proposition composed of an antecedent and consequent, indicating the antecedent to be antecedent and the consequent to be consequent; this designation occurs by the word `if' or by the word `therefore' or an equivalent \cite[TC I, 3, p. 67, alt.]{Buridan2015}.
\end{quote}

Buridan offers this criterion because of the material inadequacy of more common criteria on a token-based semantics, i.e. one where the bearers of truth are actual written or spoken sentences. The criterion according to which a consequence is good if it is impossible for the antecedent to be true and the consequent not fails in cases where the consequent may not exist, and hence be neither true nor false --- e.g. `Every man runs, therefore some man runs' is invalidated by the case where the antecedent is uttered and the consequent is not. The same criterion amended to only consider cases where the antecedent and consequent are formed remains inadequate for propositions with self-falsifying antecedents (or self-verifying consequents) that nevertheless describe a possible situation --- e.g. `no proposition is negative, therefore no donkey runs'. A third criterion, on which `one proposition is antecedent to another which is such that it is impossible for things to be altogether as it signifies unless they are altogether as the other signifies when they are proposed together' \cite[TC I, 3, p. 67]{Buridan2015} is rejected for the same underlying reason as the prior two: it assumes things being as a proposition signifies suffice to make that proposition true.\footnote{\cite[TC I, 1, p. 63]{Buridan2015}. Cf. \cite[pp. 854,  957-958]{BuridanKlimaSD}.}

Curry's paradox is a paradox of self-reference that may be formed in any self-referential logical language $L$ including a detachable conditional, substitution, and contraction. It is formed when a term $(C)$ is defined in $L$ as follows:
\begin{displaymath}
(C) \stackrel{def}{\equiv} (C) \rightarrow \phi
\end{displaymath}

Here, $(C)$ is a name for a proposition having itself as antecedent, and $\phi$ an arbitrary proposition. $\phi$ is then derived as follows:

\bigskip 
\fitchprf{}{
\subproof{\pline[1.]{C}}{
	\pline[2.]{C \lif \phi}[Def C: 1]\\
	\pline[3.]{\phi}[\life{1}{2}]
}
\pline[4.]{C \lif \phi}[\lifi{1-3}]\\
\pline[5.]{C}[Def C: 4]\\
\pline[6.]{\phi}[\life{4}{5}]
}
\bigskip 

Notoriously, Curry's paradox remains a problem even for logics which perform better than expected when treating other self-referential paradoxes like the Liar \cite{Restall2007} \cite{Weber2014}.

In the above formulation, Curry's paradox involves an object-language conditional and substitution of co-referring terms. Curry's original formulation of the paradox did not use substitution, but universal instantiation and the set-theoretic membership relation \cite{Curry1942} \cite{Read2010b}. More recently, another version of the paradox has been developed not from a detachable conditional, but from a binary validity predicate $Val$,  defined as follows: 
\begin{center}
$\vdash Val(\ulcorner \alpha \urcorner , \ulcorner \beta \urcorner)$ iff  $\alpha \vdash \beta$
\end{center}

Given the above schema, a deduction exactly parallel to that above may be carried out with a sentence $\pi$, constructed as follows:

\begin{displaymath}
\pi \stackrel{def}{\equiv} Val(\ulcorner \pi \urcorner , \ulcorner \phi \urcorner)\footnote{See \cite{BeallMurzi2013} \cite{Zardini2013} \cite{Murzi2014} \cite{Ripley2015}.}
\end{displaymath}

In this last formulation, the paradox resembles another whose name the Curry paradox sometimes shares \cite{PriestRoutley1982}, the \textit{Pseudo-Scotus paradox}. The earliest known formulation of this paradox comes from the author of a questions commentary on Aristotle's \textit{Prior Analytics} attributed to John Duns Scotus in the Wadding edition of his works, where it has the following form:

\begin{center}
God exists, therefore this consequence is not valid \cite[p. 227]{Pseudo-Scotus2001}.
\end{center}

If we let $\phi$ name the proposition `God does not exist', and $\pi$ the proposition `This consequence is valid', then Pseudo-Scotus' paradox can be seen to contraposit the right-hand side of an instance of Curry's paradox. Prior to Pseudo-Scotus' formulation, a disjunctive equivalent to Curry's paradox for material implication is found in Thomas Bradwardine's \textit{Insolubilia}.\footnote{Bradwardine's example is `A man is an ass or Socrates utters a false proposition', where this is all Socrates says. \cite[6.3, p. 97]{Bradwardine2010}.} And later, a more exact instance of the Curry paradox appears in Albert of Saxony's \textit{Perutilis Logica}.\footnote{Albert's example is `If God exists, some conditional proposition is false', positing that this is the only conditional proposition \cite[pp. 359-360]{Albert1988}.}

Pseudo-Scotus' formulation of the paradox is given as a counterexample to an approach to consequence on which `it is necessary and sufficient that it be impossible that when the antecedent and the consequent are formed simultaneously, the antecedent is true and the consequent is false' \cite[p. 226]{Pseudo-Scotus2001} - that is, as a counterexample to the second criterion Buridan rejects above. Pseudo-Scotus considers: first, Buridan's first criterion, then his third, then his second, settling on a criterion of consequence that modifies Buridan's second [i.e. Pseudo-Scotus' third] considered criterion with an exceptive clause, excluding the case where the `the signification of the consequent is incompatible with the signification of the sign of consequence' \cite[p. 228]{Pseudo-Scotus2001}.

What Pseudo-Scotus doesn't note, however, is that the paradox also provides a counterexample to Buridan's final, settled definition of consequence. Proof: Pseudo-Scotus' consequence is either valid or invalid. If it's valid, it's invalid, by \textit{modus ponens}. And if it's invalid, then it's invalid by reiteration. So if it's either valid or invalid, it's invalid. Hence, if God exists, the consequence is invalid. God exists. Therefore, the consequence is invalid.

Continuing, whatever follows from a necessary truth is itself necessary. For both Buridan and Pseudo-Scotus, `God exists' is a necessary truth. Hence, the consequence is necessarily invalid. I.e. it is necessary that it is possible that God exists and the consequence is not invalid. Hence, it is possible that the consequence is not invalid, i.e. it is not necessary that the consequence is invalid. Hence, it is both necessary and not necessary that the consequence is invalid. \textit{Ergo, tu es asinus}.

%2. The case for Buridan's priority
%2.1 The addition of detail in Scotus' textual parallels
%2.2 The absence of a response to Pseudo-Scotus' paradox in Buridan, anywhere.
%2.1 Evidence already accepted (e.g. PS knows Buridan's PA commentary)
%3. Undermining the case for Scotus' priority
In light of the above, let us now turn to the question of the relation between Buridan's and Pseudo-Scotus' texts. Parallel passages for what follows are provided in an appendix.

It is beginning to be more widely assumed that Pseudo-Scotus' account of consequence antedates Buridan's \cite[ch. 6]{Lagerlund2000} \cite[pp. 252-253]{Johnston2015}  \cite[pp. 4-5]{Read2015}, the principal piece of evidence for this being that Buridan considers and rejects an analysis of divided modal propositions Pseudo-Scotus appears to advocate.\footnote{Cf. \cite[In anal. pr. I, q. 26, pp. 143-144]{Pseudo-Scotus1891}, \cite[TC II, 4, p. 97]{Buridan2015}.} On Buridan's analysis, a modal of possibility is equivalent to one where the subject is ampliated to include possible instances of itself. E.g. `A can be B' is analyzed as `What is or can be A can be B'. On Pseudo-Scotus', the aforementioned proposition is said to be equivalent to `What is A can be B or what can be A can be B'.

Closer examination of parallels between Buridan's and Pseudo-Scotus' texts, however, repeatedly shows Pseudo-Scotus' formulations to be more complex than their Buridanian counterparts. This does not mean Pseudo-Scotus' formulations are more correct. But the addition of detail, whether clarifying or convoluting, is a sure sign we are dealing with a later text.\footnote{That Pseudo-Scotus' treatise is later is assumed, without being supported, by \cite{Boh1982}, \cite{King2001}, \cite{DutilhNovaes2008}, and \cite{Knuuttila2008}.}

Pseudo-Scotus' first criterion for consequence verbally parallels Buridan's first. But a minor change leaves it closer in content to Buridan's second criterion. Where Buridan's formulation has one proposition antecedent to the other when its impossible for it to be true with the other \textit{not being true}, Pseudo-Scotus' replaces `not being true' with `false'. Since propositions are only true or false when they exist, Buridan's counterexample to the criterion does not apply to Pseudo-Scotus' formulation: he pays heed to the verbal expression while effectively speeding up the discussion by passing over it's content. Hence, the counterexample Pseudo-Scotus applies to the criterion is similar to Buridan's for the second: Buridan offers `no proposition is negative, therefore no ass is running'; Pseudo-Scotus, `Every proposition is affirmative, therefore no proposition is negative'. In both cases, the problem addressed is one where correspondence conditions for the truth of the consequence come apart from the conditions for its being satisfied, and so the consequent cannot itself exist in the situation wherein it obtains. 

The parallel between Buridan's formulation of his second criterion and Pseudo-Scotus' of his third is also exact, excepting Pseudo-Scotus' substitution of `false' for Buridan's `not being true'. However, Pseudo-Scotus' use of his paradox as a counterexample to his third proffered definition, rather than a conditional with a self-falsifying antecedent, as Buridan uses, suggests he understands the criterion differently than Buridan does. Where Buridan's second definition is closer to Pseudo-Scotus' third in its formulation, albeit to Pseudo-Scotus' first in its content, Pseudo-Scotus' third formulation is actually closer to Buridan's settled definition. Today, we would say Pseudo-Scotus takes the phrase `when the antecedent and consequent are formed simultaneously' to have wide scope, where Buridan construes the formation of the consequence as a condition within the scope of the phrase `it is impossible that'.\footnote{Formally, let $Val$ be a validity predicate, $\phi$ and $ \psi$ be sentences, $Formed$ a predicate meaning its argument is formed, $T$ and $F$ truth and falsity predicates, and $S$. Pseudo-Scotus' third criterion for validity is: 
\begin{center}
$Val(\phi, \psi) \equiv Formed(\phi) \wedge  Formed\psi \wedge \neg \diamondsuit(T(\phi) \wedge F(\psi))$.
\end{center}
Buridan's second, by contrast, is:
\begin{center}
$Val(\phi, \psi) \equiv \neg \diamondsuit(Formed(\phi) \wedge Formed(\psi) \wedge T(\phi) \wedge \neg T(\psi))$
\end{center}. Buridan's third formulation would then be identical to Pseudo-Scotus' third, albeit substituting $S$ and $\neg S$ for Pseudo-Scotus' $T$ and $F$.} Hence, Pseudo-Scotus' understanding of the criterion requires a stronger counterexample than that Buridan offers against it.

The same economy is present in Pseudo-Scotus' dropping the phrase `both being formed together' from the third definition Buridan offers. Since the definition is offered in terms of signification rather than truth, the actual formation of the consequent is irrelevant, and the phrase specifying its formation becomes otiose.

Other differences include the following. Pseudo-Scotus, mentions besides form, also the disposition of the terms in his definitions of formal and material consequence. Pseudo-Scotus subdivides formal consequence, where Buridan does not. And where Buridan defines simple and as-of-now consequence in terms of the impossibility of the antecedent being true and consequent being false together, Pseudo-Scotus defines it in terms of a criterion Buridan gives later, the ability to be reduced to a formal one by adding some necessary proposition to the antecedent. Pseudo-Scotus employs the same reduction criterion in his definition of as-of-now consequence, where Buridan simply states that an \textit{ut nunc} consequence is one which is not good simply. In these last two cases, Pseudo-Scotus is actually \textit{more} faithful to Buridan's account than Buridan himself is. Buridan's assumed definition of simple consequence conflicts with his division of consequences, the reason being that the definition does nothing to exclude formal consequences from being simple, though Buridan classifies simple under material consequence. And Buridan's definition of \textit{ut nunc} consequence does nothing to distinguish \textit{ut nunc} consequences from those which are in no way valid.

As for Pseudo-Scotus' analysis of divided modals, the analysis shows strong signs of being at worst a misreading of Buridan's position. The structure of question 26 of the \textit{Prior Analytics} commentary is that of a comparison between two approaches to modal conversions: one, an ampliation-based reading where the subject supposits disjunctively; the other, where divided modals of possibility are ambiguous. The first reading is evidently Buridan's; the second, Ockham's.\footnote{For an analysis and extension of Ockham's approach, see \cite{Archambault2017c}} The question describes the manner of conducting conversions on both approaches, without deciding between the two. It is thus somewhat misleading to describe an error Pseudo-Scotus' makes in describing Buridan's analysis as his own position, since he never gives it preference over the Ockhamist analysis.

That the Pseudo-Scotus analysis is intended as one of Buridan's position is clear from its invocation of the same language one finds in Buridan's \textit{Tractatus de Consequentiis} to describe his own position. Pseudo-Scotus' states that `with respect to a verb of possibility in an indefinite or particular proposition, the \textit{subject} supposits disjunctively for those which are or for those which can be'\cite[In anal. pr. I, q. 26, p. 143]{Pseudo-Scotus1891}. This is exactly what one finds in Buridan's own account \cite[TC II, 4, p. 97]{Buridan2015}. This intention is further evident from Pseudo-Scotus' explicating the conversion of such a proposition as one with a disjunctive \textit{predicate} \cite[In anal. pr. I, q. 26, p. 145]{Pseudo-Scotus1891}. 

Further analysis, however, shows the error in analysis is not Pseudo-Scotus', but \textit{Buridan's}. On Buridan's analysis, `Some A can be B' is analyzed as `Something which is or can be A can be B'. This is formalized in turn as $\exists x((Ax \vee \diamond Ax) \wedge \diamond Bx)$, where quantification is assumed to be possibilist. Given that an assertoric proposition implies one of possibility, the disjunct from the left-hand side can be eliminated, and this simplifies to $\exists x(\diamond Ax \wedge \diamond Bx)$. Now, by disjunction introduction, this implies $\exists x(\diamond Ax \wedge \diamond Bx) \vee \exists x(Ax \wedge \diamond Bx)$. And that this is indeed equivalent to the first disjunct alone is shown by cases. If the first disjunct is true, then the conclusion is immediate. If the second, then something is both $A$ and possibly $B$. But since truth entails possibility, it follows that $\exists(\diamond Ax \wedge \diamond Bx)$, hence, in either case, the entailment follows. Thus, the equivalence holds just as Pseudo-Scotus says it does. The argument Buridan gives in TC II. 4 against the analysis is an \textit{ignoratio elenchus}, since it changes the example to one where the modality is before a negation. This ensures the proposition is not one of the form Buridan says it is, since the example Buridan gives is equivalent to one of the form `Some A is not necessarily B', which isn't at all an affirmative divided modal of possibility, but rather a negative one of necessity.

Further evidence of the later date of Pseudo-Scotus' analysis may be garnered from the following observations. First, it is already accepted that the Pseudo-Scotus knows Buridan's \textit{Questions on the Posterior Analytics} \cite[pp. 4-5]{Read2015}. Second, the author additionally appears to have knowledge of the \textit{Sophismata}, since he uses a sophism Buridan admits as true - `a man will be a boy' - in an objection to the conversion of divided modals into assertoric propositions.\footnote{\cite[in. anal. pr. I, q. 26, p. 143]{Pseudo-Scotus1891}. Cf. \cite[pp. 878, 888]{BuridanKlimaSD}}. Third, one of the objections Buridan raises to the disjunctive-proposition analysis of particular divided modals of possibility is that its contradictory, would have to be not a disjunction, but a conjunction of two universal propositions \cite[TC II, 4, p. 98]{Buridan2015}. But this cannot be used as an objection to Pseudo-Scotus' position, since he explicitly uses such an analysis \cite[in anal. pr. q. 26, p. 144]{Pseudo-Scotus1891}. Lastly, the analysis on which Pseudo-Scotus' text is earlier leaves us with an unsolved question, namely what Pseudo-Scotus' source is, if not Buridan's \textit{Tractatus}, given that the Pseudo-Scotus presentation is clearly reporting the views of others. This problem doesn't arise, however, on the view that Buridan's text is the earlier one: we can accept the analysis Pseudo-Scotus reports is Buridan's own contribution.

Now to dissolve the \textit{causa apparentiae}: there is a simpler explanation for the target of Buridan's remarks. According to Buridan, ambiguous written or spoken propositions are mapped to a single mental proposition, i.e. the disjunction of its specified readings \cite[QE 3.2]{BuridanQE}. But according to the early analysis found in Ockham \cite[SL II, ch. 25]{OckhamSLI} \cite{PriestRead1981} and arguably even in Aristotle \cite[Pr. An. 19, 32B 25-32]{AristotlePrA} \cite[pp. 243-245]{Johnston2015}, modals of possibility are ambiguous between just the readings one finds in Pseudo-Scotus listed as the proposition's disjuncts. Buridan is reading his own commitments concerning ambiguity back into the earlier analysis. As such, Buridan's rejection of the analysis in his \textit{Treatise on Consequences} does nothing to suggest it postdates Pseudo-Scotus' text.
\section{Conclusion}
The above allows us to make two points: one historical, the other critical.

The historical point: the Pseudo-Scotus paradox appears to have arisen as a way of generating paradox precisely at a point where truth-based accounts of consequence were ceding to other alternatives --- for instance, Buridan's in terms of signification. Pseudo-Scotus' paradox thus would have been understood to show paradox still lurks about even when it is no longer \textit{truth} that we are concerned to save from the beast. The paradox thus represents a critical moment in the movement toward the proliferation of more \textit{ad hoc} solutions to the paradoxes of self-reference in later medieval logic.\footnote{See, for instance, the criticism of Swyneshed's solution in \cite{Read2016}.}

As for the critical point: Buridan's TC is a logic without truth \cite{Klima2008}, inasmuch as the notion of truth plays no direct role in his account of consequence. It is not thereby, however, a logic without paradox. What is strange about the Curry paradox, its analogues and extensions is not that they allow one to infer absurdity, but that what they entail is arbitrary: not \textit{all} instances of paradoxical hypothetical propositions in his language are false: some are even good material consequences.  Let the following proposition be formed within a Buridanian account of logical consequence:

\begin{center}
If the Pseudo-Scotus paradox is valid, this article is published.
\end{center}

In some cases, truth is stranger than paradox. Therefore, etc.
