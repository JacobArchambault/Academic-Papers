\section{Logic and semantics}
The breadth of Klima's scholarship is vast: 
historically, it stretches from some of philosophy's best-known figures in Anselm, Aquinas, Ockham and Descartes to lesser-known figures including Thomas of Sutton and Henry of Ghent, to Frege, Geach, Kenny, and others who have produced some of the most impactful scholarship in the analytic tradition; 
systematically, he has contributed to debates on identity, categories, and causation in metaphysics, on skepticism in epistemology and theories of mental content in philosophy of mind, on others too numerous to mention.

Klima's largest arguably contributions come in his research on John Buridan - which has helped elevate Buridan from a lesser-known figure to one whose stature is closer to that of an Ockham, arguably surpassing the Franciscan in his logic - and in the field of semantics. 

In semantics, Klima was one of the earliest to adopt and expand on the use of restricted quantification in mathematical logic, using it both to formalize the medieval theory of supposition and to provide a general account of quantitively ambigous sentences in natural language.
