\title{Modal logic as assertoric syllogistic}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This article develops a novel interpretation of the modal system \textbf{D}, one on propositional functions are interpreted as terms, material implication as the copula, and $\box$ and $\diamondsuit$ as operators for forming universal and particular judgments, intuitively corresponding to the terms `every' and `some'. I show that on this intepretation, there is a fragment of \textbf{D} that validates exactly the arguments of Aristotle's assertoric syllogistic.
