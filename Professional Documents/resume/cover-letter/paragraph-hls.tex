Prior to my current position, 
I taught metaphysics, Latin, and classical political theory at Highlands Latin School, 
an advanced classical high school in Louisville, Kentucky. 
In Latin, I instructed capable middle-school students in translating both to and from Latin at a level higher than that I initially received in my first two years of college Latin, 
with text assignments principally focused on Caesar. 
My Latin classes incorporated daily lessons in Latin syntax, 
and drew on recent research in Latin phonology and philology to help clarify features such as perceived irregularities in noun declensions. 
My ontology teaching focused on categories of being in Aristotle's \emph{Metaphysics} 
and on the full reconstruction of multi-part textual arguments given only in enthymematic form in classic texts such as Plato's \href{https://jacobarchambault.com/teaching-materials/philosophy-of-human-nature/philosophy-of-human-nature-homework/}{\emph{Euthyphro}} and Thomas Aquinas' \href{https://jacobarchambault.com/teaching-materials/philosophy-of-human-nature/}{\emph{Summa Theologiae}}. 
%and on providing students with the interpretive skills necessary to critically understand classical philosophy texts. 
By year's end, I had led sophomores and juniors who began the academic year unable to explain how the word `therefore' linked what preceded it to what came after it to write work at a level that I only began to see among my peers in graduate school.
