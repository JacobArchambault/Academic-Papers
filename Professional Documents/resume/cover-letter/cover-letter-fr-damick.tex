I'm writing concerning your request for a website developer for a new Orthodox classical school near you. I think my background would be a good fit for the project, and I'd be interested in helping this project get off the ground. I'll first explain my experience with Wordpress and in programming more broadly, then how my background would be helpful specifically for a classical education project.

I have three years experience in web and application development, and seven with WordPress.
\input{cover-letter/paragraph-waystar} 
In addition to the above, I've maintained my own \href{https://jacobarchambault.com}{professional website} with WordPress for seven years. Though I don't currently have social media accounts, in the past I've had the site's blog section linked to cross-post automatically to Facebook, Twitter, and Medium.com. I've also developed numerous websites and other applications, which are available at my \href{https://github.com/JacobArchambault}{GitHub} page.

\input{cover-letter/paragraph-phd} 
This includes \href{https://www.academia.edu/41385588/Counterpossibles_and_Normal_Defaults_in_the_Filioque_Controversy}{two} \href{https://www.academia.edu/19927006/Nature_will_and_the_Fall_in_Augustine_and_Maximus_the_Confessor}{articles} specifically in the history of Orthodox theology, and several \href{https://fordham.academia.edu/JacobArchambault}{others} in historical theology more broadly.

\input{cover-letter/paragraph-hls} 

The above answers directly to both the immediate knowledge necessary for the job and broader familiarity with classical education and Orthodox theology that would fit well with this position. My family and I first began personally exploring Orthodoxy in 2009, and were received into the Orthodox faith in 2016. We currently attend St. Michael's Antiochian Orthodox Church in Louisville, KY. Regardless of whether you choose me or someone else for this particular task, the success of this school is something I'd like to see, and I would be happy to help out in whatever capacity would be welcome. My email is \href{mailto:jacobarchambault@gmail.com}{jacobarchambault@gmail.com}. Let's keep in touch.
