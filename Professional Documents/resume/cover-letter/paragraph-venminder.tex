While at Venminder, I built .NET applications in a performant CQRS architecture, deployed them using ECS, Fargate, and AWS CloudFormation as an IaC solution; leveraged my skill in building database queries to bring significant cost and performance improvements to our database queries after our company migrated from SQL Server to PostgreSQL; suggested cloud improvements including the introduction of alpine images and multi-stage builds to improve image size and security, and effected changes in our communication structure to bring about a closer collaboration between developers and QA.
