I hold a PhD in philosophy, specializing in logic, and a doctoral certificate in medieval studies from Fordham University, the latter of which was a cross-disciplinary program involving coursework in theology, history, and Latin palaeography outside in addition to my main course of study. 
My \href{https://www.academia.edu/32939933/The_development_of_the_medieval_Parisian_account_of_formal_consequence}{dissertation} traced the earliest development of the concept of formal consequence
in late medieval logic, demanding 
broad knowledge 
of the history of philosophy, 
of medieval Latin, 
and 
of semantics for classical and non-classical logics 
as well as  
expertise with translating between natural and formal languages. 
Since 2014 I have published an \href{https://brill.com/view/journals/viv/56/3-4/viv.56.issue-3-4.xml?language=en}{edited volume} and  
\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-019-00229-x}{numerous} \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-017-0162-7}{journal} \href{https://www.jstor.org/stable/43658430}{articles} and  \href{https://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/64716}{book} \href{http://www.collegepublications.co.uk/dialogues/?00005}{contributions}
in 
ontology, 
the philosophy of logic, 
and the history of science, 
and presented papers introducing new results in logic, semantics, and medieval philosophy across three continents.
