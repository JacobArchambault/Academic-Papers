\opening{To the team at the \companyname{},}

Thank you for the opportunity to interview with you this past week for the \position{} opening at the \companyname{}. I appreciated the opportunity to learn about the technologies, applications, and workflows employed at \companynameshort{}: the questions the team asked me were helpful in clarifying the kinds of problems the team has to solve for when considering questions like application security, AMI image selection, load balancing and deployment strategies, and I enjoyed the rapport with everyone on the chat. Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you next week.
