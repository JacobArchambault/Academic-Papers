\opening{To the team at \companynameshort{},}

Thank you for the opportunity to interview with you this past week for the \position{} opening at \companynameshort{}. I appreciated the opportunity to learn about your tech stack and workflow - the questions the team asked me in the multi-factor authentication scenario laid out were helpful in clarifying the kinds of problems the team has to solve for, and I enjoyed the rapport with everyone on the chat. Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you next week.
