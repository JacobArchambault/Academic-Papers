I currently work as a full-stack C\# .NET developer on the DevOps application team for Waystar, a health care solutions company that automates connecting patient and insurance provider information for hospitals. In my current role on the DevOps team, I've pioneered refactoring and converting several .NET framework services into containerized .NET core apps running in Docker, led training on using YAML for Azure DevOps pipeline configuration, and set up around 20 team projects in Azure DevOps server, for which I also contributed to and streamlined the documentation. In my previous role on the architecture team, I contributed to a company-wide .NET framework testing application for new prospective employees. In that role, I improved our web layout for smaller screens using Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries, wrote Ajax requests to send and receive data from our backend servers, and brought our HTML code in line with semantic HTML standards. On the back-end, I normalized SQL databases, modeled different business domains in both SQL database tables and C\# classes mapped to these via the Entity Framework ORM, and performed queries in both SQL and LINQ.
