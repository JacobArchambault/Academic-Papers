I currently work as a full-stack C\# .NET developer on the DevOps application team for Waystar, 
a health care solutions company that automates connecting patient and insurance provider information for hospitals. In this position, I've regularly written SQL queries, normalized backend SQL databases, and modeled different business domains in both SQL database tables and C\# classes mapped to these via the Entity Framework ORM. 
In addition to this, I have practice with both RDFS, Owl and SparQL syntax and semantics broadly and with specific ontology frameworks such as KR and BFO.
