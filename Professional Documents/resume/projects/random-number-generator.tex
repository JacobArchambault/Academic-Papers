\datedsubsectionnarrow{2021}{Random number generator}{}{A Java \href{https://github.com/jacobarchambault/RandomNumber}{tutorial} illustrating how to achieve both high cohesion and loose coupling through the injection of object dependencies and the use of multiple interface implementations, based on an application generating random numbers to then reading from a .TXT file. Beginning with a large body of procedural code executed entirely within a static main method, this application is refactored through successive commits to place distinct functionality into various classes in accordance with the principles of SOLID programming design. The final result is an application making heavy use of dependency injection even to the point of injecting strings and other instances of relatively low level classes. Because of this, it even becomes possible to make all non-static methods parameterless.}
