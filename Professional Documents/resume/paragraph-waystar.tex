I currently work as a full-stack C\# .NET developer on the DevOps application team for Waystar, 
a health care solutions company that automates connecting patient and insurance provider information for hospitals. 
Besides developing web features with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap, and JavaScript and jQuery, 
my job regularly requires me to model different business domains 
via both SQL database tables and C\# classes mapped to these via the Entity Framework ORM. 
I hold certifications in Python and SQL, have several Visual Basic projects on my GitHub page, and am currently working on porting several programs from .NET framework to .NET core in my current position. These skills answer directly to the need for \jobrequirement{} that would benefit this position best.
