{Philosophy, Latin, and classics teacher}
{Louisville, KY. Taught college-level material in Latin, ontology, and classics at advanced private high school. 
	Led ontology students to fully reconstruct arguments 
	and critically explicate texts from Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and others. 
	Led Latin students to translate both from and to Latin, 
	with assignments principally focused on Caesar. 
	By pairing classic texts with carefully designed assignments, 
	I improved student learning outcomes 
	while decreasing student workload, 
	leading 90\% of students to earn the highest letter grade available.}
